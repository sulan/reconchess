.. _reconchess-HTTP-api:

HTTP API
========

This is the HTTP API of the reconchess server, and is used when you play a remote game. We provide scripts
and code to use this HTTP API with the python package by default, but if you are using another language
you will need to make HTTP requests to these endpoints to play remote games.

Authorization
--------------

The HTTP API uses basic authorization, so you will need to provide the username and password
in the Authorization header.

User Endpoints
--------------
